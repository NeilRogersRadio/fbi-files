# The Neil Rogers FBI Files

In the late 1980s, a lawyer named Jack Thompson, had a crusade to get Neil Rogers taken off the air. Thompson recorded many hours of the Neil Rogers Show and contacted the FBI. Thompson was unsuccessful. Thirty years later, thanks to an FOIPA (Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts) request, that information has been released.

Included are 2 PDFs and one audio tape. The audio tape begins on February 11, 1988 and then has chopped up sections for shows in the weeks and months that followed.
